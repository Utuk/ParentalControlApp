### Parental Control App

This is an Android App that allows account holders to program video/audio watching playlists for their children to watch. The main account holder is able to transmit through bluetooth to other android devices which have a connected downloaded display screen from the app. The display screen will then play the desired playlist. This gives parents piece of mind knowing they have programmed and approved what their child is watching. 

It also enables the parent to create long playlists where video after video automatically loads and plays to keep the child entertained during long periods of time when this form of entertainment is needed. Some examples would be for car trips and plane rides, it is hard for children of any age to sit still for extended times and in such cirumstances it may be difficult if not unsafe for the parent to try to entertain the child.
